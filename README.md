# badown (renamed megadown in my github , forked from https://github.com/stck-lzm/badown)

The name is a short for bash-downloader.
This script can download files from mediafire, zippyshare & mega (file & folder).
It fully support folder download on mega.
Futhermore, you can control the bandwidth with the option, `-s 70K` or `--speed 1M`.

### dependencies
It requires:
* bash (tested with 4.4), 
* wget (tested with 1.19), 
* gzip (tested with 1.8),
* awk  (tested with 4.1),
* openssl aes-128-(cbc, ecb & ctr)
* (coreutils).

### usage
To execute the script give it execute right.  
`chmod +x badown`
  
To download a file:  
`./megadown 'https://mega.nz/#F!NogxFaIK!PavsMkUPQSXJ_o5zwCs5Ew'`  
`./megadown 'https://mega.nz/folder/NogxFaIK#PavsMkUPQSXJ_o5zwCs5Ew'`  
`./megadown 'https://mega.nz/#!RnQFkTYS!rFIJp7MBKxcS-Po8okSSoykR17KpIGV7xcXNZvpx38I'`  
`./megadown 'https://mega.nz/file/RnQFkTYS#rFIJp7MBKxcS-Po8okSSoykR17KpIGV7xcXNZvpx38I'`  
`./megadown 'https://www.mediafire.com/file/jbbbncd27n5mukh/test.zip'`  
`./megadown 'https://www74.zippyshare.com/v/WjE4KUUF/file.html'`  
It is unziped for the first link.  
Those links refer to the same zipped test folder.  
And might be dead for inactivity, however they will stay here for the syntax.  
  
To download from a file with a lot of urls just use a loop for:  
`for i in $(cat urls); do ./badown $i && sleep .5; done`  

### todo
- Find a more stable solution for Zippyshare,   
(there is 5-ish line of code in js that needs to be interpreted in order to produce a number.  
this number protect the download link and need to be computed.  
the formula to get this number changes quite often.)
- Add more sites and resume paused download.  
- Extend mega function with specific file in folder download.  
- Add proxy support, else as an option or as a function with automatic grabber.
